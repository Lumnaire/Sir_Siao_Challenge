      <h1>童磨 | Doma</h1>
      <p>Doma is the misanthropic and nihilistic leader of the Eternal Paradise Faith,
        a cult that worships him as a god. Unlike his fellow Upper Ranks, he became a
        demon for no particular reason at all and would spend most of his life as a demon
        killing and devouring women, including Kotoha Hashibira and the Flower Hashira
        Kanae Kocho. These actions would make Doma the arch-nemesis of Kanae's sisters
        Shinobu and Kanao, along with Kotoha's son Inosuke. The three of them would finally
        slay him during the Infinity Castle Arc, albeit at the cost of Shinobu's life.</p>
